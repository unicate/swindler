# Swindler

> Swindler creates fake test data. Simple & extensible.

## What is it?
Swindler has a lightweight core that consists only of three parts:
- Randomizer: A class, that of course, generates random values.
- RandomBuilder: The RandomBuilder uses the Randomizer to easily create random patterns, like phone numbers, etc.
- Plugin Mechanism: Plugins can be used to extend the functionality or add data providers.
